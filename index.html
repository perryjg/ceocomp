    <h1>How many lifetimes would it take you to earn just one year's salary for one of the top Atlanta CEOs?</h1>
    <p>
      Assuming you start working when you turn 21 and stop just before your 65th birthday,
      we calculate how many working lifetimes it would take to earn the equivalent of
      just one year's take-home pay for the chief executive officers of Atlanta's top
      publically-traded companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      CEO take-home pay, or their "realizable pay," includes the value of all the cash, perks
      and company stock taht a CEO gains ownership of during a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>median family income</strong> in the Atlanta metro is <strong>$50,000</strong> a year.
      That would result in <strong>take-home pay</strong> of about <strong>$38,780</strong>. <strong>Minimum wage</strong>
      is <strong>$7.35</strong> an hour, or a little less than <strong>$15,288 annually</strong>. Estimated
      <strong>take-home pay</strong> would be <strong>$6.40</strong> an hour or <strong>$13,300</strong> annually.
